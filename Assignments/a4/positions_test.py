"""Some demonstrations of the use of class Positions and related functions
    from positions.py.

    Also tests whether students can use networkx to draw org charts.

    STUDENTS: try running this file on the command line, i.e.,
        python positions_test.py

    if you get an error saying that name networkx is not defined,
    do the following on the command line (not interactive mode):

        pip install networkx

    If you don't get such a message, but running python on this file fails to
    produce a figure with a "web" of positions, do the following on the
    command line:

        pip install --upgrade networkx

    If after you try the relevant option above and you still aren't getting
    a figure produced when running this file, please post on Piazza with
    some details of any error messages or output.
