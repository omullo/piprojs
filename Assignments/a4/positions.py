            value None): the netid of the person holding this Position, or
            int 0 if the position isn't vacant but a netid for the position
            holder is unspecified, or None if the position is vacant.
        sups (list of Positions, possibly empty): The list of Positions that
            are direct supervisors of this Position. There are no repeats in it.
        subs (list of Positions, possibly empty): The list of Positions that
            this Position directly supervises, i.e., its direct subordinates.
