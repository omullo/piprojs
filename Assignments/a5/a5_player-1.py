class Player():
    """
    A player represents the state of one particular participant in an Uno game. 
    A player instance can attempt to play a card by suggesting a card to play.  
    A player has subclasses which may be human players or AI players.
    
    This is an abstract class.  An abstract class is a class, typically a
    parent of several subclasses, that doesn't have a lot of functionality
    on its own and is actually intended to be incomplete.  This incomplete
    functionality is caused by at least one abstract method, methods which are
    defined but have no implementation.  For Player, this class has one abstract
    method, suggestACard.  As an abstract class, the Player class should not be
    instantiated directly.
    
    Instance Attributes:
        name [str]: A non-blank name for this player for easy identification.
        hand [list of UnoCards, may be empty]: A list of cards currently in the
