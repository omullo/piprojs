    An Uno card is an extension of the standard playing card that provide two 
    additional features. It is capable of determining whether it can be placed 
    on top of another card.  And also, it can define an optional action to take 
    on the game state when the card is played.
    
    Instance Attributes:
        specialName [str or None]: A short name of any special ability that this 
            UnoCard has or None if the card doesn't do anything special.

        In addition to defining the suit and rank, also define the special name.
