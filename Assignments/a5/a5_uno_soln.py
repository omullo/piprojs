This module contains an implementation of an Uno-like game using standard 
52-card playing cards.

    """
    Uno is a game where players take turns attempting to get rid of the cards in 
    their hand by adding them to a shared pile.  The first player with no cards in
    his/her hand wins.  This is a version of Uno with a few simplified rules and 
    using a standard 52-card deck rather than a specialized deck.
    
    This class maintains the game state, defines and enforces rules for player 
    actions, and evaluates and declares a winner.  More detailed rules will be 
    listed in the method specifications of the appropriate method.
    
    Instance Attributes:
        players [list of Players]: A list of players in this game, in play order.
        deck [list of UnoCards, may be empty]: A list of remaining cards to draw 
                from.
        pile [list of UnoCards, may be empty]: A list of cards in the shared pile in
                the order added.
        gameState [UnoGameState]: Stores the state of the game between player turns.
    """
    
    STARTING_HAND_SIZE = 5 # How many cards to give each player at the beginning of the game.

        Creates a new game of Uno and sets it up.  In doing this, we create a new, 
        shuffled deck, deal out the players, and set up a default play order.
        
        One way that this implementation of Uno differs from the normal game is that
        we're using the suits and ranks of standard playing cards.  Because a 
        standard playing card deck has only 52 cards (without Jokers) and a standard
        Uno deck has 108 cards, we will instead use three copies of a standard card 
        deck to make sure we have enough cards.

            p [list of Players]: A list of players for this game, in play order, where
                the first player is at index 0.  This list must be non-empty and contain
                only Player instances and have at least 2 players.

        A helper method that creates and returns a list of cards drawn from the

        removed from the deck.  The returned hand is a list of the cards removed 
        from the deck.  The size of the hand should not be larger than 
        self.STARTING_HAND_SIZE or however many cards are in the deck, whichever
        is smaller.

            You are not required to include loop invariant comments.

        Start and execute the game of Uno.  This method does not end until a winner
        is declared and the game is over.  This method controls the flow of the game,
        following and updating the between-player state that is stored in
        self.gameState.
        
        The general flow of the game should look like this:
            1. Determine who the next player is from the self.gameState.nextPlayer 
                attribute and the list of players.
            2. If the previous player played a card that caused this player to draw 
                extra cards (as seen in the self.gameState.numExtraCardDraw attribute),
                draw and remove them from the front of the deck and add them to the
                next player's hand.  If there are not enough cards in the deck, draw
                as many as possible and reset the numExtraCardDraw attribute to zero.
            3. Allow the next player to perform their turn.
            4. Update the game state for the next player.
        
        Requirement: This should be implemented using only while loops; no for loops.
            You are not required to include loop invariant comments.
        Hint: When finding the next Player instance in the list of players, the
            gameState.nextPlayer pointer can exceed the length of the list of players.
            You need to calculate the remainder of places by which the pointer exceeds
            the length of the list to find the appropriate player.
        Hint: Make use of the helper functions below.
